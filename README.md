# Verus Game Cartridge (VGC)
This Whitepaper Summary consolidates Seed Logic, VDXF Architecture, and Economic Model into a single roadmap for the Verus Game Cartridge Protocol.

It’s in a similar spirit to jl777’s ROGUE, but for a lemonade stand game as an example.

Can be reused for any single player gameplay, where the “character” has an auditable saved history.

Mint ID then the game logic runs deterministically.

Anyone is free to build it, and it’s open for discussion.

Initially I tried to design it as a decentralized multiplayer co-op, but it got too complicated for my goals, so I reverted back to the single player game design because it was easier & more cost effective to play/maintain. Maintenance is free of on-chain costs in the single player architecture.
